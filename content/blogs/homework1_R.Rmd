# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
alcohol_direct <-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")
summary(alcohol_direct)
skimr::skim(alcohol_direct)

#<country> is a character variable, all the other ones are double (numbers); skim function tells us there are no missing values

```


Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
top25_beer <- drinks %>%
  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>%
  top_n(n = 25)

ggplot(top25_beer, aes(y = reorder(country, beer_servings), x = beer_servings)) +geom_col()


```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

top25_wine <- drinks %>%
  arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>%
  top_n(n = 25)

ggplot(top25_wine, aes(y = reorder(country, wine_servings), x = wine_servings)) +geom_col()


```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
top25_spirit <- drinks %>%
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) %>%
  top_n(n = 25)

ggplot(top25_spirit, aes(y = reorder(country, spirit_servings), x = spirit_servings)) +geom_col()

```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

> Generally speaking countries tend to consume the alcoholic product they produce: wine for Mediterranean and central countries, beer and spirits for northern and eastern countries. On top of this some high income northern and central countries consume large quantitites of wine despite not typically producing much of it (Denmark,Luxembourg, Belgium, ...)

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?

```{r}
#skim is going to return the number of unique titles, I can confront this with the number of rows to understand whether there are duplicates. Skim also gives me the number of NAs
#Result: no NAs, 2961-2907 = 54 duplicates
skim(movies)
```

- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
```{r}
#We use tally to count the number of titles by genre; to sort them we use the attribute "sort"
movies %>% group_by(genre) %>% tally(sort=TRUE) 
```
- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order
```{r}
#We group by genre and then use summarize to define the new variables and to create the table; with arrange we sort the table in the order we want

movies %>% group_by(genre) %>% summarize(av_gross_earn=mean(gross), av_budget=mean(budget),return_on_budget=(av_gross_earn/av_budget)) %>% arrange(desc(return_on_budget))
```
- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.
```{r}
#We group by director, then we use summarize to define the required variables, top_n to select the top 15, and arrange to sort them in order of total gross earning
movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarize(tot_gross_earn=sum(gross),av_gross_earn=mean(gross), med_gross_earn=median(gross), sd_gross_earn=sd(gross)) %>% top_n(n = 15) %>% arrange(desc(tot_gross_earn))

```

- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 
```{r}
#We group by genre and then use summarize and show on the table the different variables requested
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarize(av_rat=mean(rating), min_rat=min(rating), max_rat=max(rating), med_rat=median(rating),sd_rat=sd(rating))
#With ggplot we create an histogram of the distribution of ratings, we also used the attrivute "color" to understand the impact of each genre on the distribution
ggplot(data=movies, aes(x=rating,fill=genre))+geom_histogram()
```


## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?
  
  
```{r, gross_on_fblikes, fig.height = 5, fig.width =10}
ggplot(data=movies,aes(y=gross,x=cast_facebook_likes))+geom_point()+xlim(0,150000)+ylim(0,400000000)
#We plotted the gross earnings on the y axis they are the dependent variable and the facebook likes on the x axis as they are the independent variable. 
#From the graph it seems that the likes that cast's members receive on FB is not a good predictor of the earnings of the movies: points don't seem to lie around a precise line. 
#Note: we added limits to make the graph more readable.
```

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r, gross_on_budget, fig.height = 5, fig.width =10}
ggplot(data=movies,aes(y=gross,x=budget))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
#From the plot we can see budget is probably a valid predictor of gross earnings, although maybe not a precise one because points do not lie tight on the trend line
```
  
  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r, gross_on_rating, fig.height = 5, fig.width =10}
#From the plots below ratings seem to be good predictors of gross earnings, at least for the categories that can count on a good number of data points; there is one exception, namely "documentary": for this genre ratings seem to be uncorrelated with earnings, if not even negatively correlated.
ggplot(data=movies,aes(y=gross,x=rating,color=genre))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~genre)+theme(legend.position = "none")+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


# Returns of financial stocks


> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector, fig.height = 5, fig.width =10}



nyse_summary <- nyse %>% group_by(sector) %>% summarize(count_bysector=tally(sector)) %>% arrange(desc(count_bysector),.by_group = TRUE)
print(nyse_summary)

ggplot(data=nyse_summary)+geom_bar(aes(x=count_bysector,y=reorder(sector,count_bysector)),stat="identity")


```


Next, let's choose the [Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add `SPY` which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The following code 


```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

djia_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"


#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF

```

Now let us downlaod prices for all 30 DJIA consituents and the SPY ETF that tracks SP500 since January 1, 2020


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2000-01-01",
         to   = Sys.Date()) %>% # Sys.Date() returns today's price
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
group_by(symbol) %>% 
summarize(min_mon_ret=min(monthly_returns), max_mon_ret=max(monthly_returns), med_mon_ret=median(monthly_returns), av_mon_ret=mean(monthly_returns), sd_mon_ret=sd(monthly_returns))

```


Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns, fig.height = 5, fig.width =10}

ggplot(data=myStocks_returns_monthly,aes(x=monthly_returns))+geom_density()+facet_wrap(~symbol)

```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky? 

> Apple seems the riskiest since the curve is more spreaded, indicating a comparatively greater variability (expressed by higher SD), the SP500 ETF (predictably), is the least risky with the smallest spread (smallest SD)

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot, fig.height = 5, fig.width =10}
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
group_by(symbol) %>% 
summarize(min_mon_ret=min(monthly_returns), max_mon_ret=max(monthly_returns), med_mon_ret=median(monthly_returns), av_mon_ret=mean(monthly_returns), sd_mon_ret=sd(monthly_returns)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=av_mon_ret,x=sd_mon_ret,label=symbol))+geom_point() +ggrepel::geom_text_repel()

```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

> We can infer that as sd (risk) increases, the mean (expected return) also increases, however there are many cases in which for a higher level of risk there isn't a higher level of expected return. For example PG, KO, CSCO and others all have a higher sd  than JNJ but none of them has a higher expected return.


# Is inflation transitory?


> You may find useful the material on [downloading economic data from the FRED](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/#data-from-the-federal-reserve-economic-data-with-tidyquant). 

A recent study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claimed that the [Current Inflation Spike Is Just Transitory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/current-inflation-spike-is-just-transitory-new-bis-study-argues). As the article says, 


> The surge in inflation seen across major economies is probably short lived because it’s confined to just a few sectors of the economy, according to the Bank for International Settlements. 

> New research by the BIS’s Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Egon Zakrajsek and Dora Xia adds to one of the hottest debates in economics -- how long the current surge in consumer prices will last. Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his euro-area counterpart Christine Lagarde have said the pickup is probably transitory, despite a snarled global supply chain and a spike in energy prices. 

You have to download data for CPI and the 10 year bill and produce the following graph


```{r cpi_10year, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cpi_10year.png"), error = FALSE)
```


The relevant indicators from FRED are:

- [Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)
- [10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GS10)


```{r, get_cpi_10Year_yield}

cpi  <-   tq_get("CPIAUCSL", get = "economic.data",
                       from = "1980-01-01") %>% 
  rename(cpi = symbol,  # FRED data is given as 'symbol' and 'price'
         rate = price) %>% # we rename them to what they really are, e.g., cpi and rate
  
  # calculate yearly change in CPI by dividing current month by same month a year (or 12 months) earlier, minus 1
  mutate(cpi_yoy_change = rate/lag(rate, 12) - 1)

ten_year_monthly  <-   tq_get("GS10", get = "economic.data",
                       from = "1980-01-01") %>% 
  rename(ten_year = symbol,
         yield = price) %>% 
  mutate(yield = yield / 100) # original data is not given as, e.g., 0.05, but rather 5, for five percent

# we have the two dataframes-- we now need to join them, and we will use left_join()
# base R has a function merge() that does the same, but it's slow, so please don't use it

mydata <- 
  cpi %>% 
  left_join(ten_year_monthly, by="date") %>% 
  mutate(
    year = year(date), # using lubridate::year() to generate a new column with just the year
    month = month(date, label = TRUE),
    decade=case_when(
      year %in% 1980:1989 ~ "1980s",
      year %in% 1990:1999 ~ "1990s",
      year %in% 2000:2009 ~ "2000s",
      year %in% 2010:2019 ~ "2010s",
      TRUE ~ "2020s"
      )
  )

```

```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width =10}
library(ggrepel)
mydata %>% ggplot(aes(y=yield,x=cpi_yoy_change,color=decade,label=date))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~decade,scales="free",ncol=1)+ggrepel::geom_text_repel()+ theme_bw()+geom_text_repel(check_overlap = TRUE,aes(label=format(date, format = "%b %Y")),size=2.5)+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+theme(legend.position = "none")+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle("How are CPI and 10-year yield related?") +xlab("CPI Yearly change") + ylab("10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate") + labs(caption = "Data Source: FRED")
                                                                                                                          
```

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the  article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpeg"), error = FALSE)
#comment for the teacher: I had to make the previous line a comment because the image does not load.
```


You dont have to worry about the blue-red backgound and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1. To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh) 
1. You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
1. Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)
 



# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor).
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian. 


The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.


```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# similar graphs and analyses can be found at

# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )
```
